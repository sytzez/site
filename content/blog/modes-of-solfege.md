## The two skills of solfege

Solfege, in its broadest sense, is really the study of mapping different representations of music to eachother.
It eaches the skill of both *recognising* and *reproducing* music in those representations.

```mermaid

        A[Music]
        subgraph solfege
        B[Recognition]
        C[Reproduction]
        end
        A---B
        C---A
```

Music's main medium is sound, but it can also be represented by symbols in what's called musical notation.
Besides symbols, musical can be described in written or spoken language.
Recognition means recognising the sound, notation and terminology of music.
Reproduction means reproducing the sound, writing the notation and describing music accurately.

## The three representations

A musical element is the smallest building block of music such as a pitch, an interval or a note value.
Each musical element can be expressed in three different representations.
If you can recognise and reproduce each representation, you have mastered the solfege of that musical element.
The three reperesentations of a musical element are: its sound, its name and its notation.

```mermaid
graph LR
        subgraph Musical element
        A[Name]---B[Sound]
        B---C[Notation]
        C---A
        end
```

For example: the pitch C4 has an identifiable sound quality, a certain frequency.
While the timbre, dynamic or articulation of the sound might vary, the identifiable part is its frequency (assuming a certain tuning).
Regardless of the tuning, it has an identifiable quality in the context of other pitches in the same tuning: C4 is always a whole tone below D4.
Besides its sound quality, C4 also has a position on the musical staff, relative to the clef.
Its sound is its sound, its name is C4, its notation is the position on the staff.

Another example is the interval of a major third (M3). While the M3 doesn't have a specific pitch, its quality is identifiable when heard.
Each dyad of notes that is a major third apart has that sound quality. It is also recognisable in notation, by the vertical distance between two notes.

You could argue that a major third is not identifiable purely by its sound, because an augmented second (A2) has the same sound quality.
When the interval is isolated this is true, but in a broader musical context (assuming tonal harmony), there is a definite difference between a M3 and a A2,
related to the melodic outline it's used in, or the functional harmonic progression the chord with the interval is part of.
So it's possible to recognise a M3 or a A2 purely by listening. And that is definitely part of solfege.

The same three representation can be derived from rhythmic note values, chords, dynamics, articulation, tempo indications, tonalities, modulations, time signatures and other musical elements.

## The six modes

Solfege is the skill of translating music from one representation to another.
It is *recognising* musical elements in one representation, and *reproducing* that same element in another representation.
Since we've determined there are three representations of music, there must be six (two times three) ways of doing solfege.
I'll call them modes of solfege.

```mermaid
graph TD
        A[Sound]-->|Sound to Language|B[Language]
        B-->|Language to Notation|C[Notation]
        C-->|Notation to Sound|A
        A-->|Sound to Notation|C
        B-->|Language to Sound|A
        C-->|Notation to Language|B
```

To master a musical element means to master each of these six modes:
Sound to language, language to notation, notation to sound, sound to notation, language to sound and notation to language.
Each of them can be practised separately.
For example, sound to name means listening to a sound and being able to call the element by its name, without using any notation.
Notation to sound means being able to read notes and hear in your head or physically reproduce the sound accurately.
Looking at those examples you can easily imagine the other modes.
Once you're able to perform each of these six modes for a specific musical element, the three representations will become a unified trinity in your mind.
You'll be able to understand and utilize the musical element to its full extent.
