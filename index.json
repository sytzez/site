[{"content":"The two skills of solfege Solfege, in its fullest sense, is the art of translating musical ideas from one representation into another. It teaches the skill of, on the one hand, recognising music in all its forms and, on the other hand, reproducing music in another form.\ngraph RL A[Music] subgraph solfege B[Recognition] C[Reproduction] end A---B C---A Music\u0026rsquo;s primary medium is sound. Another common medium is music notation, which is written using special musical symbols known as \u0026rsquo;notes\u0026rsquo;. Besides being represented by symbols, music can be described in written or spoken language. The availability of musicological terminology can make verbal descriptions as precise or even preciser than musical notation.\nSolfege teaches the ability of understanding each of these three forms, as well as being able to accurately reproduce the same musical idea in another form.\nThe three representations A musical element is the smallest building block of music such as a pitch, an interval or a note value. Each musical element can be expressed in the three different representations mentioned before. If you are able to recognise and reproduce each representation, you have mastered the solfege of that specific musical element. The three reperesentations of a musical element are its sound, its name and its notation.\ngraph LR subgraph Musical element A[Name]---B[Sound] B---C[Notation] C---A end For example: the pitch \u0026lsquo;C4\u0026rsquo; (C natural in the fourth octave) has an identifiable sound quality, a certain frequency. While the timbre, dynamic or articulation of the sound might vary, the identifiable part is its frequency (assuming a certain tuning). Regardless of the tuning, it has an identifiable quality in the context of other pitches in the same tuning: C4 is always a whole tone below D4. Besides its sound quality, C4 also has a position on the musical staff, relative to the clef. Its sound is its sound, its name is \u0026lsquo;C4\u0026rsquo;, its notation is the position on the staff.\nAnother example is the interval of a major third (M3). While the M3 doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a specific pitch, its quality is identifiable when heard. Each dyad of notes that is a major third apart has that sound quality. It is also recognisable in notation, by the vertical distance between two notes.\nYou could argue that a major third (M3) is not identifiable purely by its sound, because an augmented second (A2) has the same sound quality. When the interval is isolated this is true, but in a broader musical context (assuming there is tonal harmony), there is an objective difference between a M3 and a A2, related to the melodic outline it\u0026rsquo;s used in, or the functional harmonic progression the chord with the interval is part of. making it possible to recognise the different between a M3 or a A2 purely by listening. And that is definitely part of solfege.\nThe same three representation can be derived from rhythmic note values, chords, dynamics, articulation, tempo indications, tonalities, modulations, time signatures and other musical elements.\nThe six modes We\u0026rsquo;ve determined that solfege requires both recognising and reproducing musical representations. We\u0026rsquo;ve also determined that there are three main representations of a musical element.\nFor each musical element, we can \u0026lsquo;do\u0026rsquo; solfege in a number of different ways by varying the representation we recognise and the representation we reproduce. Since there are three representations, there must be six (two times three) ways of doing solfege. I\u0026rsquo;ll call them modes of solfege.\ngraph TD A[Sound]--\u003e|Sound to Language|B[Language] B--\u003e|Language to Notation|C[Notation] C--\u003e|Notation to Sound|A A--\u003e|Sound to Notation|C B--\u003e|Language to Sound|A C--\u003e|Notation to Language|B To master the solfege of a musical element means to master each of these six modes: Sound to language, language to notation, notation to sound, sound to notation, language to sound and notation to language. Each of them can be practised separately.\nTo give example of one of these modes: \u0026lsquo;sound to name\u0026rsquo; means listening to a sound and being able to call the element by its name, without using any notation. \u0026lsquo;Notation to sound\u0026rsquo; means being able to read notes and hear in your head or physically reproduce the sound accurately. With some imagination you can easily imagine the other modes.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re able to succesfully perform each of these six modes for a specific musical element, the three representations will become a unified trinity in your mind. You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to understand and utilize the musical element to its full extent.\n","permalink":"https://sytzez.com/blog/modes-of-solfege/","summary":"The two skills of solfege Solfege, in its fullest sense, is the art of translating musical ideas from one representation into another.

Getting content out there on \u0026rsquo;the web\u0026rsquo; might help me promote the things I\u0026rsquo;m doing, attract likeminded people or people that can help me in my endeavours, and it can help me hold myself accountable to the ideas I get and the goals I set for myself. Possibly it will do none of those things, but it will still help me think \u0026lsquo;out loud\u0026rsquo; and allow me to practise putting thoughts into words.\nCreating any content whatsoever will also train my content muscle and make me a better content producer, so for now the quality doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. I\u0026rsquo;ll just try creating as many blogs as possible. (warning to self: that sounds like a goal and accountability). Creating something daily or even weekly might be a bar too high, with the little amount of free time I have these days. I won\u0026rsquo;t set any goals for now, let\u0026rsquo;s see where it goes.\nThe thing stopping me from doing this lately was simply not being able to choose a platform to blog on. I wanted something that won\u0026rsquo;t cost me too much time and effort, so building my own site in Laravel or Ruby on Rails was out of the question. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried Wordpress and other more modern content managing systems like Wix, but those just didn\u0026rsquo;t feel right. Then I came across the Hugo templating system, driven by the Go programming language. I was amazed at first by the speed of it. It was able to render over 18000 pages in under a minute at the company I\u0026rsquo;m working at. When I looked more into it, I really liked the file structure it forces you to use, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make too many decisions yourself, and the fact that it deals with assets such as CSS and JS/TS for you, and that it allows you to just write pages using Markdown. I was already using Markdown for personal and work related notes, using a pretty cool tool called \u0026lsquo;Obsidian\u0026rsquo;, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a huge adaptation for me to start blogging in Markdown. I also like that is just generates a static site that I can plop onto any hosting platform or even just on Github sites. I also like being able to just Git versioning and not having to rely on some website to edit my content.\nFor now I\u0026rsquo;m just using an existing theme to get familiar with Hugo templating, but I\u0026rsquo;ll probably create my own simple theme at some point. (Uh oh, more accountability). Anyway that\u0026rsquo;s enough for now.\nSome ideas of future blog posts:\nLaying out my ideas of classical music composition. (I already have a draft ready) Analysing some pieces using those ideas. Implementing a shortcode to display music notation in Hugo. (using Vexflow) Talking about the music app I\u0026rsquo;m working on. Discovery and comparison of different existing apps similar to the app I\u0026rsquo;m building (and how mine\u0026rsquo;s better). Programming related stuff, especially related to Rust.
