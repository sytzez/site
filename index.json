[{"content":"The two skills of solfege Solfege, in its broadest sense, is really the study of mapping different representations of music to eachother. It eaches the skill of both recognising and reproducing music in those representations.\ngraph RL A[Music] subgraph solfege B[Reproduction] C[Recognition] end A---B C---A Music\u0026rsquo;s main medium is sound, but it can also be represented by symbols in what\u0026rsquo;s called musical notation. Besides symbols, musical can be described in written or spoken language. Recognition means recognising the sound, notation and terminology of music. Reproduction means reproducing the sound, writing the notation and describing music accurately.\nThe three representations A musical element is the smallest building block of music such as a pitch, an interval or a note value. Each musical element can be expressed in three different representations. If you can recognise and reproduce each representation, you have mastered the solfege of that musical element. The three reperesentations of a musical element are: its sound, its name and its notation.\ngraph LR subgraph Musical element A[Name]---B[Sound] B---C[Notation] C---A end For example: the pitch C4 has an identifiable sound quality, a certain frequency. While the timbre, dynamic or articulation of the sound might vary, the identifiable part is its frequency (assuming a certain tuning). Regardless of the tuning, it has an identifiable quality in the context of other pitches in the same tuning: C4 is always a whole tone below D4. Besides its sound quality, C4 also has a position on the musical staff, relative to the clef. Its sound is its sound, its name is C4, its notation is the position on the staff.\nAnother example is the interval of a major third (M3). While the M3 doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a specific pitch, its quality is identifiable when heard. Each dyad of notes that is a major third apart has that sound quality. It is also recognisable in notation, by the vertical distance between two notes.\nYou could argue that a major third is not identifiable purely by its sound, because an augmented second (A2) has the same sound quality. When the interval is isolated this is true, but in a broader musical context (assuming tonal harmony), there is a definite difference between a M3 and a A2, related to the melodic outline it\u0026rsquo;s used in, or the functional harmonic progression the chord with the interval is part of. So it\u0026rsquo;s possible to recognise a M3 or a A2 purely by listening. And that is definitely part of solfege.\nThe same three representation can be derived from rhythmic note values, chords, dynamics, articulation, tempo indications, tonalities, modulations, time signatures and other musical elements.\nThe six modes Solfege is the skill of translating music from one representation to another. It is recognising musical elements in one representation, and reproducing that same element in another representation. Since we\u0026rsquo;ve determined there are three representations of music, there must be six (two times three) ways of doing solfege. I\u0026rsquo;ll call them modes of solfege.\ngraph TD A[Sound]--\u003e|Sound to Name|B[Name] B--\u003e|Name to Notation|C[Notation] C--\u003e|Notation to Sound|A A--\u003e|Sound to Notation|C B--\u003e|Name to Sound|A C--\u003e|Notation to Name|B To master a musical element means to master each of these six modes: Sound to name, name to notation, notation to sound, sound to notation, name to sound and notation to name. Each of them can be practised separately. For example, sound to name means listening to a sound and being able to call the element by its name, without using any notation. Notation to sound means being able to read notes and hear in your head or physically reproduce the sound accurately. From these examples you can easily imagine the other modes. Once you\u0026rsquo;re able to perform each of these six modes from a musical element, it will become a unified trinity. You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use and understand the musical element to its full extent.\n","permalink":"https://sytzez.com/blog/modes-of-solfege/","summary":"The two skills of solfege Solfege, in its broadest sense, is really the study of mapping different representations of music to eachother.

Getting content out there on \u0026rsquo;the web\u0026rsquo; might help me promote the things I\u0026rsquo;m doing, attract likeminded people or people that can help me in my endeavours, and it can help me hold myself accountable to the ideas I get and the goals I set for myself. Possibly it will do none of those things, but it will still help me think \u0026lsquo;out loud\u0026rsquo; and allow me to practise putting thoughts into words.\nCreating any content whatsoever will also train my content muscle and make me a better content producer, so for now the quality doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. I\u0026rsquo;ll just try creating as many blogs as possible. (warning to self: that sounds like a goal and accountability). Creating something daily or even weekly might be a bar too high, with the little amount of free time I have these days. I won\u0026rsquo;t set any goals for now, let\u0026rsquo;s see where it goes.\nThe thing stopping me from doing this lately was simply not being able to choose a platform to blog on. I wanted something that won\u0026rsquo;t cost me too much time and effort, so building my own site in Laravel or Ruby on Rails was out of the question. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried Wordpress and other more modern content managing systems like Wix, but those just didn\u0026rsquo;t feel right. Then I came across the Hugo templating system, driven by the Go programming language. I was amazed at first by the speed of it. It was able to render over 18000 pages in under a minute at the company I\u0026rsquo;m working at. When I looked more into it, I really liked the file structure it forces you to use, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make too many decisions yourself, and the fact that it deals with assets such as CSS and JS/TS for you, and that it allows you to just write pages using Markdown. I was already using Markdown for personal and work related notes, using a pretty cool tool called \u0026lsquo;Obsidian\u0026rsquo;, so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a huge adaptation for me to start blogging in Markdown. I also like that is just generates a static site that I can plop onto any hosting platform or even just on Github sites. I also like being able to just Git versioning and not having to rely on some website to edit my content.\nFor now I\u0026rsquo;m just using an existing theme to get familiar with Hugo templating, but I\u0026rsquo;ll probably create my own simple theme at some point. (Uh oh, more accountability). Anyway that\u0026rsquo;s enough for now.\nSome ideas of future blog posts:\nLaying out my ideas of classical music composition. (I already have a draft ready) Analysing some pieces using those ideas. Implementing a shortcode to display music notation in Hugo. (using Vexflow) Talking about the music app I\u0026rsquo;m working on. Discovery and comparison of different existing apps similar to the app I\u0026rsquo;m building (and how mine\u0026rsquo;s better). Programming related stuff, especially related to Rust.
